This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from Chris Okasaki's
book "Purely Functional Data Structures".

Solutions are written in [Literate Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming).
Remarks from me, if any, would be typesetted *in italics*.

If you fing a bug or something, I would appreciate you opening an issue.
